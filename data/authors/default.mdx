I have 𝗱𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 in t͟e͟c͟h͟n͟o͟l͟o͟g͟y and b͟u͟s͟i͟n͟e͟s͟s, including:
- Creating SaaS products

My 𝗳𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀 is:
- 🔍 Identifying unmet needs

In my 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, I'm very happy to be able to:
- Have a hands-on approach by: researching, proposing, and implementing ideas
- Taking ownership of product features
