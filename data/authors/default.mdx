I'm a **self-taught web developer** and an aspiring [indie hacker](https://www.indiehackers.com/about).

I'm passionate about automating redundant work by creating intuitive tools (check out my [projects](/projects)).

I'm also interested in philosophy, AI and the future of automation.

I've worked as a project manager and a technical writer, and coded many small tools on side either for personal or internal company use. However, recently I've made a leap to gain professional development experience.

If you'd like to share anything at all - feel free to get in touch via LinkedIn or email!
